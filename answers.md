- **1a.**
Greedy algorithms would be optimal, since coins are of a power of two, with a greedy algorithm, there will be a guarantee of change using the largest coin possible until there is no amount remaining.

- **1b.**
Work: O(logN)
Span: O(logN)




- **2a.**

It cannot work optimally is because like before, it will select the largest coin possible, however this time there could be a case where a smaller coin originally would do better than before, since the power is of 2^2.

- **2b.**
- work: O(kN)
- Span: O(klogN)


- **3a.**






- **3b.**






- **3c.**
